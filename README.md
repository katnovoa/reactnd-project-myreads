# MyReads Project

This is the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal of this template is to save you time by providing a static example of the CSS and HTML markup that may be used, but without any of the React code that is needed to complete the project. I built the app by breaking down the app into 3 components, Search,Main, and books. The main page has three shelves that users are able to move the books between shelves. The search page allows users to search for new books to add to their shelves. After selecting books to add to shelves, when you navigate back to the home page the you can instantly see the selections made on the search page.
